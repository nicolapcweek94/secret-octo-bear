Just another extremely simple expenses management script.   
It uses a very stupidly designed SQLite database to store data, so you need SQLite installed (actually, you just need the SQLite module for Python) for this to run.   

The name comes from Github, obviously.

To use this, you have to first run `python dbinit.py` that creates the .db file and the required table inside it, and then run `python sob.py` to get help on how to use the script.
